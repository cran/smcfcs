  \item{d}{Indicator of whether event 1 occurred (d=1), event 2 occurred (d=2) or individual was censored (d=0)}
  \item{x1}{Partially observed binary covariate, with linear effects on log competing risk hazards}
  \item{x2}{Partially observed normally distributed (conditional on x1) covariate, with linear effects
  on log competing risk hazards}
